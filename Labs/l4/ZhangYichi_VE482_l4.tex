\begin{itemize}
\item The program can be divided into three layers, what are they?

The first is the implementation of linked list, the second is the implementation of file reading and data processing, and the third is the cli or user interface implementation

\item What are the three stages performed when compiling a file? Briefly describe each of them.

The three main stages are: Preprocessing(process macros, defined compiling conditions and so on), assembling(turn the file into machine code) and linking (link the libraries)

\item Search more details on how to generate static and dynamic libraries.

In Cmake, the task can be accomplished through those commands: 

\begin{lstlisting}
    add_library(api_static STATIC api.c)
    add_library(list_dynamic SHARED list.c)
\end{lstlisting}

\item What is the difference between a library and the API.

API is implemented for operating systems, but library are specified for C programming.
\end{itemize}

For the code implementation, please refer to the attached "code" directory
